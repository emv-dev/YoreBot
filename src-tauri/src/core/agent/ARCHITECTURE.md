# Atomic Chat Agent Architecture

Living engineering reference for the autonomous Rust agent in this directory.
Update this document when the agent loop, tool contract, safety policy, or
iteration scope changes. Product-wide decisions still belong in the repository
decision log in `AGENTS.md`.

## Status and scope

The agent backend is isolated from regular Atomic Chat conversations and from
the Vercel AI SDK path. It talks directly to the active local llama.cpp session
over native `/completion`.

Iterations 1 and 1b are implemented. Agent turns also accept bounded local
file and image attachments. Memory, tasks, browser automation, skills, dynamic
MCP tools, window control, and filesystem watchers are deferred.

## Current architecture

### Entry points and transport

- `agent_run_turn` starts a bounded agent turn and streams `AgentEvent` values
  over a Tauri IPC channel.
- `agent_cancel_turn` cancels a run by its caller-provided `run_id`.
- `agent_resolve_approval` resolves a pending approval by its generated
  approval id.
- `LlamaServerClient` resolves the active TurboQuant or upstream llama.cpp
  session and calls its `/completion` endpoint directly.
- Image analysis uses a separate, non-streaming `/v1/chat/completions` request
  to the same active session. It never uses the grammar-constrained agent slot.
- Every completion uses the static tool grammar, `cache_prompt`, and a stable
  slot id. The local API server on port 1337 is not part of this path.

### Prompt and grammar

- The stable prompt prefix contains the persona, rules, tool catalog,
  capabilities, and instructions.
- Frequent tools expose their complete argument schema in the stable prefix.
- Rare tools expose a one-line catalog entry until `tool.view` loads their
  complete descriptor.
- The variable tail contains loaded rare descriptors, the conversation, an
  optional loop notice, and the response marker.
- Tool output is constrained by an array-only GBNF root. One tool call is a
  one-element array; a step may contain up to eight calls at runtime.
- The prompt catalog and grammar tool-name set must remain identical.

### Loop and execution

The loop is:

1. Build the prompt.
2. Request one grammar-constrained completion.
3. Parse and validate the tool-call array.
4. Run the synchronous loop guard.
5. Execute valid calls according to resource class.
6. Append compressed observations.
7. Continue until `reply`, `finish`, cancellation, breaker, failure, or the
   step limit.

Pure reads may run concurrently. Mutating and stateful classes are serialized.
Approval-gated tools cannot appear in a multi-call batch. A terminal tool is
valid only as the final call and executes after all preceding calls finish.

### Safety controls already present

- Array-only GBNF tool grammar.
- Runtime batch-size and step limits.
- Resource-class validation.
- Repeat, no-progress, and wandering loop detection.
- Per-run cancellation tokens.
- HTTP SSRF validation and DNS/IP checks.
- Archive traversal guards.
- Process and command timeouts.
- A unified authorization preflight for resource class, resolved paths, and
  shell-guard verdicts.
- A run-scoped `ApprovalGate`: `auto_approve=true` allows approval-required
  actions; otherwise it emits a pending request and waits for decision,
  timeout, or cancellation.
- Canonical working-directory confinement with symlink-safe, call-scoped
  approval-mediated escape.
- Turn-scoped staged-attachment roots are trusted for reads only; writes and
  deletion outside the workspace remain approval-gated.
- Shell interpretation routing plus hard-block and approval-required command
  guards.

### Current tools

- Shell: `os.shell.run`.
- Filesystem: read, write, edit, trash, list, glob, grep, document read, hash,
  diff, patch, archive list/read/extract.
- Git: status, log, diff, show, blame, branch.
- Processes: list and kill.
- Network: HTTP request, web search, web fetch.
- Clipboard: read and write.
- Desktop notifications: `os.notify`.
- Vision: `vision.describe` for up to four staged PNG, JPEG, GIF, or WebP
  images when the active llama.cpp session has an `mmproj`.
- Tool discovery: `tool.view`.
- Terminals: `reply` and `finish`.

### Attachment contract

- IPC accepts at most eight attachments. Files provide a local path; images
  provide a matching base64 data URL and image MIME type.
- Before the loop starts, inputs are validated and copied into
  `<thread>/agent-attachments/<turn>/` with generated filenames. Individual
  files are capped at 50 MiB and the turn total at 100 MiB.
- The durable user turn contains only a compact attachment manifest with
  absolute staged paths. Original paths, data URLs, and base64 bytes are not
  persisted in the Agent session transcript.
- Documents remain on the existing `os.fs.read_document` parser path. Text and
  source files use `os.fs.read`; archives use the archive tools.
- Image turns are rejected before staging when the active session is not
  vision-capable. `vision.describe` repeats the capability check at execution
  time so a restarted or replaced text-only session produces a structured tool
  error instead of guessed output.

## Test pyramid

The default Rust suite is deterministic and requires neither a model nor
network access:

- Unit tests pin grammar, prompt, parser, resource-class, path-policy,
  shell-guard, approval, and loop-guard behavior.
- `runner_tests.rs` drives the real `run_turn` loop against a scripted local
  `/completion` server. It verifies request fields (`grammar`, `cache_prompt`,
  `slot_id`), prompt-tail transitions, event ordering, batching, approvals,
  cancellation, failures, and terminal reasons.
- `tools/contract_tests.rs` runs real filesystem, archive, Git, and safe shell
  operations inside an isolated workspace. It also pins traversal, path
  escape, hard-block, denial, cancellation, and output-boundary behavior.

`model_e2e.rs` is an ignored, manual acceptance ritual. It starts and stops the
externally supplied pinned upstream Windows CPU `llama-server`, loads the
externally supplied pinned Qwen3.5-9B GGUF once, and runs the Downloads Agent
scenarios sequentially against slot `0`. Routine pull requests compile the
test but do not download the model. The manual Windows workflow obtains and
verifies both artifacts from the product manifests before running it.

### Managed model E2E contract

The ignored test requires:

- `ATOMIC_AGENT_E2E_LLAMA_SERVER`: exact upstream `ggml-org/llama.cpp`
  Windows CPU build `b10431` executable.
- `ATOMIC_AGENT_E2E_MODEL`: exact `Qwen3.5-9B-Q4_K_M.gguf` from the pinned
  `unsloth/Qwen3.5-9B-GGUF` revision in the product manifest.
- `ATOMIC_AGENT_E2E_TIMEOUT_SECS`: optional startup and per-scenario timeout;
  defaults to 900 seconds.

The harness chooses a free loopback port and launches the server with one
parallel slot, an 8192-token context, Jinja templates, no Web UI, and CPU-only
inference while letting llama.cpp choose the CPU thread count. It verifies
build `10431`, uses the server directory as its working directory, prints
bounded provenance, waits for loopback `/health`, and selects the model profile
from `/props` like the product path. The ignored ritual explicitly uses the
production 180-second completion-attempt deadline; deterministic runner tests
retain their 100-millisecond deadline.

Run it from the repository root:

```bash
ATOMIC_AGENT_E2E_LLAMA_SERVER=<b10431-llama-server> \
ATOMIC_AGENT_E2E_MODEL=<Qwen3.5-9B-Q4_K_M.gguf> \
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --lib --features test-tauri \
  downloads_agent_acceptance -- --ignored --nocapture --test-threads=1
```

The test copies the actual bundled `downloads-organizer` skill into an isolated
registry and exposes only the YoreBot catalog. One persisted session must plan
without mutation, apply exactly approved non-overwriting moves, summarize disk
state, and undo one move. A separate denied session must leave its fixture
unchanged. Assertions cover calls, exact approval paths, replies, full fixture
snapshots, and terminal reasons. Failures print bounded events and server logs;
the RAII guard terminates only its owned child process.

## Iteration 1b contract corrections

1. `os.fs.archive.extract` documents canonical `destination`; the runtime
   temporarily accepts legacy `dest` and normalizes it before dispatch.
2. `os.shell.run` selects direct argv or a platform shell and always passes
   through the command guard.
3. Rare tools expose complete schemas through bounded run-scoped `tool.view`
   state.
4. Path-taking tools use the shared canonical resolver and approval-mediated
   escape policy.
5. Approval-required actions use the pending request/resolve protocol and fail
   closed on timeout or cancellation.

## Iteration 1b decisions

Iteration 1b is limited to:

- Correct existing tool contracts and add focused tool tests.
- Add the backend approval protocol; the UI is deferred.
- Add working-directory path confinement with approval-mediated escape.
- Add shell interpretation detection and a command guard.
- Add `tool.view` and `### loaded-tools` for complete rare-tool schemas.
- Add `os.clipboard.write`.
- Add `os.notify`.

Everything else remains deferred.

### Approval protocol

The design follows the useful core of `atomic-agent` without porting its
frontend-specific routers:

- Dangerous tools submit a structured pending approval request.
- A separate Tauri command resolves the request by approval id.
- Requests have cancellation and timeout behavior.
- Read-only tools continue without approval.
- Each agent run constructs an `ApprovalGate` with a global `auto_approve`
  flag. When `auto_approve` is true, every approval-required action is allowed
  without creating a pending request.
- `auto_approve` defaults to false and is supplied explicitly by the caller;
  it is not inferred from tool arguments or previous decisions.
- With no UI resolver connected, approval-required actions fail closed.
- Iteration 1b does not add persistent per-tool or per-path “always allow”
  rules.
- Resource classes continue to govern batching; approval policy governs
  whether an individual dangerous action may execute.

An approval request must include, at minimum, run id, approval id, tool name,
reason, argument preview, and affected resources. Secrets must not be included
in previews.

### Path confinement

`working_dir` becomes the default trusted root:

- Relative paths resolve beneath the canonical working directory.
- Existing targets are canonicalized before containment checks.
- Non-existent write targets validate their nearest existing ancestor and
  normalized remaining components.
- Symlink traversal must not bypass containment.
- A path outside the trusted root produces an approval request rather than an
  unconditional denial.
- Approval authorizes only the specific operation and resolved path in that
  request; it does not permanently enlarge the trusted root.

All filesystem, archive, git, shell `cwd`, and other path-taking tools must use
one shared resolver.

### Shell guard

`os.shell.run` keeps structured `cmd` plus `args`, but gains two execution
paths:

- Direct process execution when shell interpretation is unnecessary.
- Platform shell execution when metacharacters, built-ins, environment
  expansion, or a pre-joined command line require it.

Before either path starts, a guard evaluates the effective command and returns
one of:

- `allow`
- `approval_required`
- `block`

Hard-block rules take precedence over auto-approval. The guard must inspect a
tokenized view of the complete command even when execution uses a shell.

### Rare tools

Rare tools remain compact one-line entries in the stable prefix.

- `tool.view { name }` loads the full descriptor for a rare tool.
- Loaded descriptors render under `### loaded-tools` in the variable tail.
- Loaded tools are bounded by an LRU count and a token/character budget.
- Loading a descriptor must not mutate the stable prefix.
- Calling `tool.view` for a frequent, unknown, or already-loaded tool returns
  a deterministic result.
- Automatic expansion after an invalid-arguments error may be added only if it
  remains bounded and testable.

### Clipboard and notifications

- `os.clipboard.write` writes explicit text supplied by the model.
- `os.notify` emits a local desktop notification with bounded title and body.
- Both tools must expose runtime capability flags and return a clear
  unsupported result when unavailable.
- They are serialized stateful actions. They are not approval-gated by default,
  matching the `atomic-agent` contract; policy can tighten this later.

## Deferred work

- `os.fs.watch`
- `vision.describe`
- Skills and `skill.run_script`
- Dynamic MCP tool registration
- Browser tools
- Window list/focus
- Memory
- Tasks and scheduling

These features require separate architecture decisions because they introduce
long-lived resources, additional inference paths, executable content, or a
dynamic tool grammar.

## Change checklist

When adding or changing a tool:

1. Update the prompt descriptor.
2. Update the grammar name set and GBNF alternative.
3. Assign a resource class.
4. Add the dispatch implementation.
5. Apply shared path, approval, guard, timeout, and cancellation policies.
6. Add focused unit tests.
7. Verify prompt and grammar catalogs remain in lockstep.
8. Record any non-trivial decision in `AGENTS.md`.
