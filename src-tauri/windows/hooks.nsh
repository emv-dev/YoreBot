; YoreBot — NSIS installer hooks
; Extends the default Tauri uninstaller to:
;   1. Kill helper processes that hold file locks BEFORE removing files.
;   2. Clean application data directories that live outside the Tauri-managed
;      bundle ID path when the user opts in to "Delete app data".
;
; On Windows the app stores data in three locations:
;   1. %APPDATA%\app.yorebot.desktop\           — Tauri-internal store +
;                                                 settings.json (new installs).
;                                                 Cleaned by Tauri default.
;   2. %APPDATA%\YoreBot\                       — User data folder
;                                                 (models, threads, backends,
;                                                 logs, store.json,
;                                                 mcp_config.json).
;                                                 NOT cleaned by Tauri default.
;   3. %LOCALAPPDATA%\app.yorebot.desktop\EBWebView — WebView2 cache + localStorage.
;                                                 Cleaned by Tauri default,
;                                                 but on perUser/passive
;                                                 installs lockfiles can be
;                                                 left behind, so we redo it.
;
; A custom data_folder set by the user via "Change data folder location"
; is NOT covered by these hooks — the user is responsible for cleaning it.

!macro NSIS_HOOK_PREUNINSTALL
  ; Tauri's CheckIfAppIsRunning macro (called later in the Section Uninstall
  ; from the bundle template) already handles the main binary. Here we kill
  ; helper processes that the app spawns and that frequently keep WebView2
  ; / data files locked when the uninstaller tries to RmDir /r.
  ;
  ; We use taskkill so we don't depend on the nsProcess plugin being bundled.
  ; /T terminates child processes too. Errors are silently ignored — the
  ; process may simply not be running.
